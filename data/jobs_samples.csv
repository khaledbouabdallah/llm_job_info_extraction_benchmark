Forward Deployed Engineer,Athena Intelligence,"New York, NY","Engineering the Future of Work
Athena Intelligence is engineering the future of work. We're at the forefront of integrating artificial intelligence into enterprise operations, reshaping how humans and machines collaborate. Our flagship products include Olympus, an AI-native analytics platform, and Athena, an artificial employee designed to operate Olympus alongside enterprise teams.
The Role
As a Forward Deployed Engineer (FDE) at Athena Intelligence, you'll be at the intersection of cutting-edge AI technology and real-world enterprise challenges. You'll work directly with our clients to solve their workflows with a mix of our existing products and new features you will build, following our core philosophy of engineering at the edge. You'll gain unique insights into important industries and institutions while contributing to our core products.
Engineering at the Edge
At Athena Intelligence, we believe in engineering at the edge, where Forward Deployed Engineers build the first version of any product in close collaboration with a single customer. This approach allows us to rapidly iterate and validate our solutions in real-world environments, providing crucial insights that shape our product development. As adoption grows, we integrate this into our core product and deploy it across our fleet, making the FDE role the cornerstone of our product strategy and the primary source of actionable intelligence for our product team.
The AI-First Workplace
In today's rapidly evolving business landscape, companies are increasingly adopting AI-first approaches before expanding headcount - similar to Shopify's recent strategic shift. This is precisely where Athena Intelligence comes in. As an FDE, you'll be at the forefront of this transformation, helping organizations integrate AI into their core operations and demonstrating how Athena can function as a valuable AI analyst employee alongside human teams.
Core Responsibilities
Collaborate closely with clients to understand their unique challenges and operational environments
Drive adoption on the customer side: educate about AI-first work, identify valuable workflows, and champion Athena as an AI analyst employee
Design and implement solutions using Olympus and Athena to address client needs
Build new features and capabilities to solve client-specific problems
Integrate our AI technologies into existing enterprise systems and workflows
Develop and maintain client relationships, acting as a technical liaison between Athena Intelligence and our partners
Contribute to the continuous improvement of our core products based on field experiences and client feedback
Lead training sessions and provide ongoing support to ensure successful adoption of our technologies
What Makes This Role Unique
Building at the Edge
Unlike traditional engineering roles where product innovation happens from a centralized research team, at Athena Intelligence, you'll be doing something we call ""building at the edge."" This means our product innovation happens from client sites, where you'll learn something valuable, put it into practice, and then work with product and platform engineering teams to roll it back into our core products.
Creating Your Digital Twin
Part of being a Forward Deployed Engineer at Athena Intelligence involves building an AI-assisted FDE capability. You'll support and accelerate your own work by teaching our AI systems to replicate aspects of your expertise and problem-solving approach. This creates a virtuous cycle where you build capabilities that make you and future FDEs more effective, continuously expanding what Athena can do for clients.
Real Impact Through Innovation
Our second forward-deployed engineer quickly mastered a new industry—law—and translated his insights into one of our core product lines, Flows, despite never having held a formal product or development role before. This exemplifies how you can make a tangible impact on our product evolution and see your ideas come to life quickly.
This cross-industry application is a perfect example of our horizontal approach: the legal workflows we developed have since been adapted for financial compliance teams and defense contractors, showing how core capabilities can be repurposed across regulatory-heavy environments with similar needs but different domain contexts.
Tangible Impact Across Industries
Over the course of the last three years, Athena has been deployed across multiple industries, changing the way hundreds of people across different organizations do work. Our founding FDEs have been at the core of these transformations, directly shaping how AI is integrated into critical workflows and processes.
Horizontal vs. Vertical Approach
Unlike many AI companies that focus on a single industry, we build solutions that work across domains. As an FDE, you'll have the unique opportunity to work with many different industries and teach Athena to excel in diverse contexts, broadening both your expertise and our product's capabilities. We serve clients across legal, finance, defense, supply chains, retail, consulting, media & publishing sectors, with a particular focus on regulatory-heavy industries where AI adoption presents both significant challenges and opportunities.
Freedom to Experiment
We encourage the freedom to experiment with unconventional solutions to client challenges. For instance, to unlock a high-value customer workflow that required a complex browsing capability, we rolled out a human-in-the-loop labeling exercise as a fallback mechanism. This allowed us to deliver immediate value, gather crucial insights, and refine our product direction without delaying customer deadlines.
Global Exposure
In the last year alone, our forward-deployed engineering team has traveled to Belgium, Paris, London, New York, DC, Baltimore, and Los Angeles, working with some of the world's most important institutions.
What We Value
A highly analytical approach and eagerness to solve technical problems with modern tools and frameworks
Experience or curiosity about working with large-scale data and AI systems to solve valuable business problems
Ability to collaborate efficiently in teams of technical and non-technical individuals
Comfort working in a dynamic environment with evolving objectives and iterating with users

Location
This position is based in our New York City office in lower Manhattan. Athena Intelligence is a fully in-person and in-office team, working five days a week in the office. We believe in the power of face-to-face collaboration and maintaining a strong team culture through daily in-person interactions.

Description du poste

Le sujet du stage :
Amélioration de pipelines d’analyse de verbatims basés sur des LLM : robustesse, adaptation et industrialisation.
Optimisation d’une chaîne agentique NLP pour l’analyse de feedback client : personnalisation, contrôle de la génération et évaluation des performances.
Le Why du stage :
Une pipeline d’analyse automatique de verbatims a été développée en s’appuyant sur une chaîne de prompts orchestrant des modèles de langage (LLM). Cette chaîne comprend quatre étapes principales : analyse de sentiment, classification thématique, génération d’interprétations, et formulation de recommandations.

Toutefois, ce type d’approche soulève aujourd’hui plusieurs points qui limitent son industrialisation et sa capacité de généralisation. Les performances du système restent très dépendantes de la qualité des prompts et du calibrage spécifique à chaque jeu de données.
En l’absence de mécanismes de contrôle fins, les modèles peuvent produire des sorties incohérentes, non fiables, ou sensibles à des variations minimes dans les entrées, ce qui complique la reproductibilité et l’interprétabilité des résultats. Par ailleurs, le comportement non déterministe des LLM, combiné à l’empilement d’étapes agentiques, rend difficile l’analyse d’erreurs et l’optimisation systématique du pipeline.

Ces limites constituent des freins majeurs à la portabilité du système vers de nouveaux cas d’usage métier, chaque contexte client imposant des contraintes spécifiques en termes de langage, d’objectifs analytiques, de granularité sémantique ou de structure de données.

Le stage visera à répondre à ces problématiques en travaillant sur l’amélioration de la performance, de la stabilité et du déterminisme du pipeline. L’objectif sera de proposer des méthodes de pilotage plus robustes (évaluation, réglage automatique, alignement), permettant une adaptation rapide et fiable à de nouveaux jeux de données tout en respectant les exigences métiers propres à chaque client.
Les missions du stage :
Étude d’un cas client et cadrage fonctionnel du besoin.
Analyser les verbatims collectés dans un contexte métier donné (ex. : relation client, RH, marketing, etc.).
Identifier les spécificités linguistiques, thématiques et stratégiques du cas d’usage.
Définir des objectifs analytiques précis (ex. : typologie d’insatisfactions, intentions d’action, besoins implicites).
Adaptation et personnalisation de la chaîne agentique basée sur LLM.
Concevoir ou ajuster les prompts pour les étapes de sentiment analysis, classification thématique, génération d’interprétations et recommandations.
Implémenter des mécanismes de conditionnement du comportement des LLM (ex. : few-shot learning, chaînes de pensée, techniques de prompt engineering avancées).
Intégrer des contraintes client (vocabulaire, ton, type de recommandations, etc.) dans les étapes de génération.
Amélioration de la robustesse, de la fiabilité et du monitoring.
Proposer des indicateurs de performance adaptés aux différents niveaux de sortie (précision, cohérence, stabilité inter-runs, pertinence métier).
Étudier la reproductibilité des résultats, en identifiant les points de non-déterminisme et en proposant des stratégies de contrôle (température, seed, détection d'hallucinations).
Évaluation comparative et généralisation.
Développer des méthodes d’évaluation qualitatives et quantitatives des résultats (incluant de l’évaluation humaine si nécessaire).
Comparer différentes variantes de la chaîne pour identifier les meilleurs compromis entre performance, coût et stabilité.
Le déroulement du stage :
Etape 1 : Se familiariser avec la pipeline existante d’analyse de verbatims (sentiment, classification, interprétation, recommandations) et comprendre ses limites actuelles.
Etape 2 : Étudier les besoins spécifiques d’un cas client, analyser les verbatims fournis, et identifier les adaptations nécessaires au niveau des tags, des prompts ou des recommandations.
Etape 3 : Explorer différentes approches de personnalisation, incluant la génération de prompts adaptés, l’ajustement des critères de classification, ou l’utilisation de données client comme contexte (fine-tuning de modèles par exemple), développement d'un brique d'évaluation et de monitoring applicatif de la solution.

Concevoir une couche de qualification IA combinant un validateur, un modèle de langage de grande taille (LLM) en tant que juge, et des métriques composites pour transformer des résultats non déterministes en états explicables, prêts à être présentés en démonstration et publiés, destinés aux équipes QA, développement, gestion de projet et vente technique.
Détails :
À mesure que les fonctionnalités d’IA générative se déploient dans nos produits, l’assurance qualité traditionnelle ne suffit plus pour des résultats non déterministes (résumés, questions-réponses, complétions, paraphrases, génération de protocoles). Nous avons besoin de signaux de qualité mesurables et audités couvrant la véracité, la cohérence, la conformité réglementaire et la robustesse, intégrés directement dans notre pipeline de livraison.
Objectif du stage : Concevoir et prototyper un validateur de structure documentaire et des agents/métriques complémentaires qui s’intègrent dans notre pile QA existante (LLM en tant que juge, pipelines de véracité, observabilité) pour (1) appliquer les exigences structurelles et réglementaires sur les documents générés, et (2) produire des audits traçables et reproductibles, utilisables par les équipes produit, QA et conformité.
Périmètre & principaux axes de travail :
Validateur en priorité : définir les formats cibles et règles (modèles, schémas, sections obligatoires), implémenter des parseurs robustes (PDF/DOCX/JSON/XML), et un système de rapport d’anomalies avec un journal de conformité.
Couche d’intelligence : implémenter LLM en tant que juge avec traces décisionnelles ; concevoir des métriques composites (similarité sémantique, BERTScore/MoveScore, correspondance partielle exacte, véracité basée sur la recherche).
Intégration plateforme : endpoints REST API, tests unitaires et d’intégration, hooks CI/CD, journaux structurés et tableaux de bord d’observabilité ; suites de validation sur jeux de données « golden-set » et notebooks de démonstration.
Collaboration : travailler avec l’équipe QA pour prioriser les règles et collecter des cas réels.

Development and Uncertainty Quantification of Machine Learning Models for Critical Heat Flux Predictions
Durée du contrat (en mois)
6
Description de l'offre
At the Institute of Applied Sciences and Simulation for Low-Carbon Energies (ISAS) of the CEA, we focus on research and innovation in analytical sciences. As data analysis plays a pivotal role, we are interested in methodological advancements in statistics, mathematics and computer science, for instance, via the development of state-of-the-art AI models, adapted to our needs.
The Critical Heat Flux (CHF) is a physical phenomenon that may cause the deterioration of the heat transfer in the core of nuclear reactors, potentially leading to core damage. Its accurate prediction is therefore a crucial issue in nuclear reactor safety. The internship deals with the prediction of the CHF through the development of machine learning techniques and the quantification of the associated uncertainty. It will be realised in the context of an international OECD/NEA project on the development and application of AI methodologies for nuclear engineering.
Within this project, the intern will:
Perform a preliminary literature review on potential candidate artificial intelligence methodologies (such as world models and latent space alignment architectures).
Analyse the available experimental CHF database to understand the physical phenomenon and to verify the coherence and exploitability of the experimental data.
Perform an initial assessment of basic machine learning techniques applied to the prediction of CHF.
Develop different architectures to predict as accurately as possible the CHF for various geometries, e.g. annular tubes or rod bundles.
Quantify the uncertainty of the models developed during the internship, applying different state-of-the-art methodologies such as conformal prediction, hierarchical models and other coverage-driven techniques.
Present and discuss their work during technical meetings and write a final report.
The internship will be conducted at the Service of Software Engineering and for Simulation (SGLS). The service develops and qualifies the simulation tools for enhancing the precision and reliability of the models used to design and analyse the safety of the French nuclear power systems. These studies are performed within the framework of internal CEA projects or in collaboration with several industrial partners (e.g. EDF, Framatome and TechnicAtome) and international partners. The internship will be a joint operation with the Service of Thermal-hydraulics and Fluid Dynamics (STMF).
Moyens / Méthodes / Logiciels
machine learning, uncertainty quantification, deep learning, AI, nuclear engineering, CHF
Profil du candidat
The ideal candidate is a MSc. student (French M2 level) who has a good knowledge of statistics/applied mathematics with an interest in artificial intelligence and neural networks. Basic knowledge of the physics processes underlying the CHF phenomenon will be considered a plus. Good skills in Python coding and code management are required. We welcome previous experience with any major deep learning framework (PyTorch, JAX, Tensorflow) and with uncertainty quantification approaches. Given the international context of the OECD/NEA project, fluency in English is considered necessary (French will be considered a plus).
